# LogRep
### Overview
Our project will be a recipe log for meal planning that will allow users to track (and possibly search for/display on calendar) recipes and aid in ease of access.  It will allow users to log in, create and edit recipe details such as date eaten, name, description, URL where recipe can be found and possibly ingredients needed to make the recipe.
### Features
- User Login: Users will be able to log in by creating an account in the system.  All access to the site will be restricted to logged-in users (subject to change, time permitting).
- Create and edit recipes: Users will be able to create new recipes in the system by entering a mixture of required(name, description, etc) and optional fields (date, URL, ingredients, etc).
- View recent meals/sort by date last eaten: Users will be able to view a list of recent meals and click to sort by last eaten date.
- Delete recipes: Users will be able to delete recipes.
- Bootstrap implementation for better user interface/experience.
### Technologies
- C#
- ASP.net MVC
- MySQL
- Bootstrap
### What I'll Have to Learn
For the login functionality we'll have to learn to implement Identity scaffolding onto an MVC app.  Also for the search/filter we'll have to learn how to implement search functionality in an ASP.net MVC app.
